{"name": "Starbase", "description": "Starbase is a massively multiplayer online game with gameplay focused on building and designing spaceships and stations, exploration, resource gathering, crafting, trading, and combat. Alternatively the game features a sandbox mode where players can explore the game alone or with selected friends in their own universe.\n\nSet in a universe of vast scale and detail, the fully-destructible environment and hybrid voxel/vertex-based game mechanics enable simulations in the game at immense depth; minor collisions may break a few outer plates from your spaceship, while fast-speed crashes can rip the ship apart.\n\nThe scale and depth of the simulation in all aspects of the game gives players the ultimate freedom to exploit their innovativeness and creativity \u2013 the building blocks of success in Starbase. From constructing single spaceships with durable outer platings to creating massive automated factories and designing electricity and data networks, the players are free to do it their own way.", "steam": {"steam_game": false, "appid": null}, "developers": ["Frozenbyte"], "publishers": ["Frozenbyte"], "platforms": ["PC (Microsoft Windows)"], "genres": ["Simulator"], "keywords": [], "release_date": "2021-06-16", "currencies": []}
