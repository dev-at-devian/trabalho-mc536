Vindictus takes place in the same setting used in Mabinogi, but is placed chronologically several hundred years prior to the first game during a period of war and strife. Vindictus follows Nexon's traditional free-to-play model. The game itself is free to download and play and charges no purchase price. The game contains a virtual item shop to purchase in-game items with Nexon's virtual currency called NX to enhance the player's character's appearance and abilities. Also, the game has only several, pre-made, gender-locked characters representing the different classes. The game doesn't have a big persistent world, instead, it is instance based.", "steam": {"steam_game": false, "appid": null}, "developers": ["Nexon Co. Ltd."], "publishers": ["Nexon Co.
