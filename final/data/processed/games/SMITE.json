{"name": "SMITE", "description": "SMITE is the online battleground of the gods. Players choose from a diverse cast of deities and use their unique powers to triumph over the opposition in 5v5 team matches. SMITE is a new take on the MOBA genre; rather than observing from above the action, the game\u2019s third person perspective puts players into the thick of combat. Instead of clicking the mouse to move, players use the familiar WASD keys to move and fight their way through SMITE\u2019s dynamic battlegrounds.", "steam": {"steam_game": false, "appid": null}, "developers": [], "publishers": ["Tencent Games", "Hi-Rez Studios"], "platforms": ["PC (Microsoft Windows)", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Adventure", "MOBA"], "keywords": [], "release_date": "2014-03-24", "currencies": [{"id": "Smite", "name": "Smite Gold", "price": {"fixed_price": null, "unit": 8, "price_table": "../prices/coins/Smite.csv"}}]}
